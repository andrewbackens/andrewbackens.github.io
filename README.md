## Strengths
1.	Knowledge of multiple programming languages and the ability to translate code in one language to the other.
2.	I code with security as the forefront concern, with constant testing and secure methods deterring attacks on the project.
3.	I use data structures and algorithms as efficiently as possible to reduce the runtime and load on servers in my code.
4.	Customer-first mindset that is focused on developing software that is friendly to the user, avoiding headaches and clunky interfaces.
5.	I work well alongside stakeholders, communicating the project to them and shaping their needs into the finished product.

In my artifact, I have put together a project that improves on the original code. Originally, it was a school course planner that was written in C++, and I have transferred it to Python in the new version. In the original, text was prompted to the user in the terminal, and they could select an option from the menu to load the data from a .csv file, print all courses, or search for an individual course. The new code implements a new graphical user interface, adds several features to the project (such as adding a course from the interface and searching for a course using the course ID or name), introduces MongoDB to help with the reading and writing from the .csv file, and improves the Hash Table algorithm to use a Vector instead.
